          I wanted to say sorry for afternoon, I wanted to say sorry for the night. I just Find stuff to disturb you and make you upset😌. But aaj thoda appreciation banta hai , Aaj tak i said you are good at speaking but thanking for giving me that quality, Pehle I used to keep everything I felt
          withing Myself but now I have someone to atleast sy, i say some thing then feel bad but baadmein i feel so releived that I dont have to think about it now I know your response about it. I think 
          all the problems were made up by me but thankyou you dont overreact on them. And sorry for today afternoon , mujhe acchi mann nahi tha to study but I thought youll get so angry ppehle so i just didnt message you. firse bataya nahi ik🙂‍↕️ I am stoopid but aage se nahi hoga, I love studying with you, I know I am annoying sometimes but Its just your presence that does that, i also didint know about how childish I am with you but aaj jab I think of last week it couldnt be so enjoying.
          I dont know what you think of yourself but your presence mean so much still now, I never that working with you would be soo enjoying , sorry thoda obsructive behavoiur dikta hoga opffice mein but agar wo nahi rakhunga to I cant control myself in office into making it a hookup spot🫣. i take same train everyday , same problmes same stress but the way my mood cheers up after seeing you , i dot think anyone can ever do it before now and ever in the future. You deserved to be called <b>Princess👸🏻</b>
